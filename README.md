# IoT-Car
### Overview

In this project we made an RC Car which is controlled through WiFi from an android device. 
We have used Arduino Mega as a microcontroller to control this car. 
There is an Adafruit Motor shield to control four DC motors. 
We have used a WiFi shield ESP32, for connecting to a WiFi network.
 We have successfully completed two major targets of our project 
 which are, live video streaming and controlling the car from any network.

### Summary
We are trying to build up a security car which will be controlled through 
the internet and we have successfully completed this project. 
During making this project we have faced many hardware and logical 
problems, we have overcome those problems by searching solution on 
internet and meeting up with our course teacher. 
Finally we have made a good project. 
We will add additional features in future to make our project more informative and secured.
